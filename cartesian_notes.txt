> cartesian.py should take paths of trajectories and index.ndx files only and prepare everything, then calculate vectors

> cartesian_ana.py get rid of method selection? if not, test and fix all the different combinations
    - only keep "batch mode" vs "normal mode"
> cartesian_batch.py conformation change part
    .allow for only testing a single batch of datasets?
    .output dataframes
    .somehow calculate dynamical conservation, perhaps through high p-value tests

Batch for conformations:
..do away with pair-wise comparison? if i won't use "RMS", then pairwise comparing is useless and only takes performance.
    batch analysis will likely come from only grid data
