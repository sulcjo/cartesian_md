:Either get rid of "resis" modes, or complete them and do separate options for residues, backbone/sidechain atoms in specific etc.


> cartesian.py should take paths of trajectories and index.ndx files only and prepare everything, then calculate vectors
> cartesian_ana.py get rid of method selection? if not, test and fix all the different combinations
> cartesian_batch.py conformation change part
    .allow for only testing a single batch of datasets?
    .output dataframes
    .somehow calculate dynamical conservation, perhaps through high p-value tests
