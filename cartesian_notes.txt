:Either get rid of "resis" modes, or complete them and do separate options for residues, backbone/sidechain atoms in specific etc.


> cartesian.py should take paths of trajectories and index.ndx files only and prepare everything, then calculate vectors
    .also make cartesian.py read the coordinates straight from the .pdb file
    .Improve cartesian.py data handling (multithreading?)

> cartesian_ana.py get rid of method selection? if not, test and fix all the different combinations
    - only keep "batch mode" vs "normal mode"
    .Look into improving cartesian_ana.py performance
    .finding unique bins through pandas
> cartesian_batch.py conformation change part
    .allow for only testing a single batch of datasets?
    .output dataframes
    .somehow calculate dynamical conservation, perhaps through high p-value tests

Batch for conformations:
..do away with pair-wise comparison? if i won't use "RMS", then pairwise comparing is useless and only takes performance.
    batch analysis will likely come from only grid data
